[View the website on GitHub Pages](https://marina601.github.io/easy-cocktail-recipes)

I have created this site as part of my Milestone 2 project for Code Institute, 
focusing on Interactive Frontend Website development and design.

This blog is for adults, where they can browse through popular cocktail recipes and re-create them at home with minimal
effort. 
Due to the pandemic and the hospitality industry having one of the worst effects, people have missed going out and socializing. 
This website will enable adults to create simple cocktail recipes for special occasions or weekends for their friends and family to enjoy!
