# Easy Cocktail Recipes 

![Easy Cocktail Recipes](/assets/images/responsive-design.png "Am I Responsive Image") 

[View the website on GitHub Pages](https://marina601.github.io/easy-cocktail-recipes)

I have created this site as part of my Milestone 2 project for Code Institute, 
focusing on Interactive Frontend Website development and design.

This blog is for adults, where the user can easily make the popular cocktail recipes at home using the 
instructions in the recipe card and entertain their friends and family.

Due to the pandemic and the hospitality industry having one of the worst effects, people have missed going out and socializing. 
This website will enable adults to create simple cocktail recipes for special occasions or weekends for their friends and family to enjoy!

## Wireframes

For wireframes, I have used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)

Please view my wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile view:
[Wireframes](/assets/wireframes/easy-cocktail-recipe(wireframes).pdf)

- Landing Page: 
![Desktop-view](/assets/wireframes/landing-page-desktop.png)
![IPad-view](/assets/wireframes/landing-page-ipad.png)
![Mobile-view](/assets/wireframes/landing-page-mobile.png)

- During the development of the project I have added a quote to the landing page to enable the user 
understand on the landing of the page, what the site is about. 

- About Page: 
![Desktop-view](/assets/wireframes/about-desktop.png)
![Mobile-view](/assets/wireframes/about-mobile.png)

![Desktop-view](/assets/wireframes/recipe-desktop.png)
![IPad-view](/assets/wireframes/recipe-ipad.png)
![Mobile-view](/assets/wireframes/recipe-mobile.png)

- During the development I was not able to source hint and tips from the 
API used, therefore this section was left out.
- Also the layout  structure for recipe cards has changed, whilst the information provided to the user stayed the same. 
- The recipe rating does work, however, at this moment in time, this information is not recorded. 
- Looking through the information available to me via API, I have chosen to implement filter buttons, 
which filter recipes by category.

- Contact Page:

recipes.html, which I have done initially. 

- Also my mentor has introduced me to the filter method in JavaScript recipes.js to filter through the data by category and display 
 the information desired on click of the button and loading of the page. I have tried to solve this issue in many different ways 
 and have received unexpected result, working through this issue with my mentor has helped me to understand and learn the logic of 
 programming language.

- The initial code used to get the contact form to send the information has been taken from [emailJS](https://jsfiddle.net/api/post/library/pure/)
API documentation and modified to fit the site purpose.

- Responsive navbar has been created with help of a tutorial from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg)
