## Testing

- The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
- I have also used JSHints for JavaScript and jQuery code.

- [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
  -- The file passed with no major issues, the only issue was resolved was regarding transition value.

- [W3C Markup Validation]( https://validator.w3.org/)
   -- HTML code pass validation without major errors, type attribute has been removed from all <script> elements.
    
- [JSHints](https://jshint.com/)
   -- Recipes Page has presented the only error where some missing semicolons had to be added
